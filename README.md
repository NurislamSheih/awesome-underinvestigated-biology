[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Inspired by https://matthewmcateer.me/blog/under-investigated-fields/ (which is an awesome list but not an awesome-list) but with focus on all things biological. Initial offering is made by participants of Russian-speaking Biology-related telegram chat Лапкочат GANG.

### Biochemistry

[Oxygen-resistent nitrogenases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4735515/) anyone?

### Prokaryote biology

[Light detection in bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5812497/) - how does it work? 

### Eukaryote biology

[Larvamima](https://scholar.google.com.ua/scholar?cites=7346071014699236931&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=ru) - ant parasytes that mimic the larvae. After the discovery about 30 years ago only twelve mentions in reviews.

### Virology

Archaeal virii - morphology differences from bacteriophages and eukaryote virii. Are there any archaeal virii with hybrid RNA-DNA genome?  

[Fungal virii](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005172) - Why they are so often non-pathogenic for their hosts?
