[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Inspired by https://matthewmcateer.me/blog/under-investigated-fields/ (which is an awesome list but not an awesome-list) but with focus on all things biological. Initial offering is made by the participants of Russian-speaking Biology-related telegram chat Лапкочат GANG.

### Omics

[Functions of genes](https://research.a-star.edu.sg/articles/highlights/a-decline-in-gene-discoveries/) - from about 20k of known human genes we somewhat know a function of about 5k. Imagine the situation for other species.

### Biochemistry

[Oxygen-resistant nitrogenases](https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_can_we_engineer_nitrogenases_to_be_oxygen-tolerant) anyone? There could be a very promising application in industry since [the current way of nitrogen production](https://www.generon.com/how-is-nitrogen-produced-for-industrial-applications/) is quite compicated. There was [a paper twenty years ago](https://jb.asm.org/content/174/21/6840.short) with claims of finding such nitrogenase but [current results](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4735515/) contradict it.

### Prokaryote biology

[Light detection in bacteria](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5812497/) - how does it work? 

### Eukaryote biology

[Larvamima](https://scholar.google.com.ua/scholar?cites=7346071014699236931&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=ru) - ant parasytes that mimic the larvae. After the discovery about 30 years ago only twelve mentions in reviews.

[Mimicry in plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimicry_in_plants) - quite self-explanatory. There are a number of examples ([rice and Echinochloa crus-galli](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0976-1), [fallen leaves and Monotropsis oderata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotropsis)) but it still remains pretty unclear.

[Myrmecophilidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_cricket) - live almost everywhere where ants do, [no assembled genomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/all/?term=myrmecophilidae), no research on their ecology and molecular biology.

### Virology

[Archaeal virii](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro1527) - morphology differences from bacteriophages and eukaryote virii. Are there any archaeal virii with hybrid RNA-DNA genome?  

[Fungal virii](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005172) - Why they are so often non-pathogenic for their hosts?
